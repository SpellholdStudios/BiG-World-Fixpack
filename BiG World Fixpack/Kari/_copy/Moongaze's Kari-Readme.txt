Introduction and content:

This is a rebuild of a very old controversial NPC of mine that never advanced past v1.3beta.
Kari (the koboldgirl) was originally a mix between human and kobold (rat/dog like creatures in the BG series). She was not romanceable, and simply a joinable NPC for any party. Tameon The Dragoon later took over the project on the old Chosen of Mystra, and completed most of its SoA/ToB content (even including a PC/Kari romance and a sexy new portrait), only to lose everything in a harddrive crash, as he told me over instant messenger. He then moved on to other projects, such as Yeslick/Kagain. I don't know the status of Tameon's Kari, nor if it will ever see the light of day. Best you could do is PM him, though I've hardly seen him around.

Since the beta version is still mine, I've decided to rebuild the NPC under the moniker of "Moongaze's Kari", to prevent any confusion. Whereas Tameon's Kari went more along the lines of the original koboldgirl idea, my version of Kari will follow a less orthodox path: She has become an anthropomorphic wolf NPC, as I first intended her to be.

"A what?", I hear you ask. Anthropomorphic. Humanoid animals. I admit I have a weak spot for such critters, especially skunks. This NPC is a perfect way for me to enjoy such an aspect in my game. And if anyone else enjoys it, well that's awesome. ^-^

Installation and technical information:

To install, download the .rar file of the Mod, extract its contents into your main BGII folder, double-click on Setup-Kari.exe and follow the instructions on the screen.
Do not close the window during installation.

You do not need to start a new game to pick him up.
However, please uninstall any old version of Kari (v1.3b and older) and remove all its files from your BG2 folder before installing Moongaze's Kari. This because folders, filenames and such have been renamed.
Kari was made on the platform: BG2 SoA+ToB, latest Bioware ToB Patch, and latest non-WeiDU Baldurdash Fixpack and Game Text Update.

FAQ:

[Kari is revived again?]

Yes. After over a year of neglect, and the demise of Tameon's Kari, I felt I should do something to improve on my version of Kari. More content might be added later, as well.

[Where can I find Kari?]

Druid Grove.

[Is she romanceable?]

No, sorry.

[Does she have quests/encounters?]

No, she does not.

[Does she have a flirt or chat pack?]

No, not at this moment.

[Is there anything I need to be aware of?]

Not really. It's pretty safe to take Kari along.

[Will there be alternative portraits?]

Maybe, but there's no rush.

[I've found a bug! What do I do?]

Report it in the forum mentioned at the top of this file. I'll fix it as soon as possible.

Probably, yes. If you find an incompatibility, please inform me on Blackwyrm Lair forums.
