The High Queen confronts her own son, who has teamed up with the northerners. For many years, there has been a dispute between them over the domination of the islands. Atkutla supplied the queen and her army with resources and weapons through my daughter. Everything was in complete secrecy. But the prince somehow found out about it, and now my daughter has been abducted. I ask you to proceed to the islands and return my daughter. Do you have the courage to complete this task? Of course, the reward will be generous. ~
