This villain leads the sarevok fans sect, I think you know this name, because it was you who stopped him. The sect's sole purpose is to find you and all your helpers and avenge the death of Sarevok! As I already said, it seemed to me that he was a worthy paladin, so I gave him the task to eliminate Margul once and for all. He told me that it would not be easy to do, because he is his friend! Nevertheless, he took up the task, and I showed him the way to Margul's refuge. ~
