 @3 = ~ Why would the Luskan merchant guild destroy its own merchant ship? There is no logic here. ~
 @4 = ~ No, quite the opposite! We are talking about a war between ours and the Luskan trade guilds. Our guild is much stronger, and if the Luskan guild wants to crush all trade for themselves, then they will need at least a medium-sized army! ~
 @5 = ~ So it means that they want to blame it on your trading guild and ultimately on the entire Neverwinter? ~
-@6 = ~ Yes, that’s exactly what will happen, they will indict us and our city will be under siege, no one will enter and not leave Neverwinter. But that is not all. Almost simultaneously with the provocation of Luskan, a nearby fortress called Fort Helm was captured by the drow. This fort defended Neverwinter from enemies for many years and was home to Helm's servants. Perhaps one of them entered into an alliance with the dark elves. Fort Helm was conquered in half an hour. When we found out about this, it was too late. ~

We resist as much as we can, but we do not have enough strength. I heard about you from the merchants from Baldur's Gate, and I am sure that you are the only one who can stop this before it is too late. ~
