-REPLACE ~99999~ ~After <CHARNAME>'s ascension, Wikaede's faith in Helm and other Gods was shaken. He did not think the line between mortal and deity could be so thin. He returned to Athkatla, only to be expelled from the Helmite priesthood after several months. They could not tolerate a faithless priest, and sent him on his way. Wikaede lost his divine magic and became a mecenary in order to survive and have a home of sorts. After several years of mercenary employment, during a guard job on a caravan heading towards Calimport, he was poisoned by an unknown assassin, who swiftly slipped some lethal toxin in his drink. His vision blurred, his heart beating faster than ever before, and the last thing he ever heard was "The Storm Lord prevails!". His grave is said to be along the trade route between Athkatla and Calimport, but few have come. Only one person, Quicksilver Nitki, dared approach the grave of the former holy man, not to pay her respects, but to steal the magical mace he had always carried with him.~

-REPLACE ~99998~ ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Wikaede returned to Athkatla to serve at the Temple of Helm once again. Within several years he rose to the rank of High Watcher, eventually replacing Oisig when he retired. The Talassan priesthood feared Wikaede, and after several failed attempts to assassinate him, they were driven out of the city by the followers of Helm and the Order of the Radiant Heart. Unexpectedly, he fell in love with Harah, a Dawnbringer of Lathander, and became the father of her first child after a holy marriage. He never traveled the road again, but remembers the time spend with <CHARNAME> quite fondly.~
