Introduction and content:

Wikaede Olveyn started as a One-Day NPC, meaning it was originally created within the timespan of 4 hours. The remaining time was spent bugfixing, as it was my first mod ever.
He is a lawful neutral male human Priest of Helm, and gets along best with Anomen (they have a small friendship track).
He banters with every Bioware NPC in SoA and ToB, interjects at certain points in the game, and is summonable by the Fate Spirit in ToB. He comes equipped with a custom mace that has a decent enchantment.
His voiceset is an original by Moongaze.
If you wish to use the alternative portraits, simply give them the filename "mgwikaG.bmp", "mgwikaL.bmp", and "mgwikaS.bmp", after renaming the default portraits to something else.

Currently its content is being expanded beyond its One-Day NPC roots. New content will be introduced in future versions. =)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installation and technical information:

To install, download the .rar file of the Mod, extract its contents into your main BGII folder, double-click on Setup-Wikaede.exe and follow the instructions on the screen.
After the installation finished, you will see the soundfiles being processed.
Do not close the window during installation.

You do not need to start a new game to pick him up.
However, please uninstall any old version of Wikaede (v3.4 and older) and remove all its files from your BG2 folder before installing Wikaede Revisited. This because folders, filenames and such have been renamed.
Wikaede was made on the platform: BG2 SoA+ToB, latest Bioware ToB Patch, and latest non-WeiDU Baldurdash Fixpack and Game Text Update.

FAQ:

[Why is this now called Wikaede Revisited?]

Because I'm supporting this mod again, and I'm adding more content to it.

[Where can I find him?]

Temple of Helm in Athkatla.

[Is he romanceable?]

No, someone else has his interest.

[Does he have quests/encounters?]

At this moment, his first SoA quest is under construction. It is not shipped with this version.

[Does he have a flirt or chat pack?]

No, not at this moment.

[Is there anything I need to be aware of?]

He will accept most things, though there are a few particular choices he cannot accept. He does not lean overly towards "good" or "evil", but more towards "lawful". 

[I've found a bug! What do I do?]

Report it in the forum mentioned at the top of this file. I'll fix it as soon as possible.

[Is it compatible with MODXX?]

Probably, yes. If you find an incompatibility, please inform me on Blackwyrm Lair forums.
